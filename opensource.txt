Open source refers to a software development model where the source code of a program or application is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute it freely. Open source software is typically developed collaboratively by a community of developers who contribute to the project and make improvements over time.

The term "open source" was first introduced in 1998 by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting open source software. The OSI maintains a set of guidelines known as the Open Source Definition (OSD) that defines what constitutes open source software.

Some of the key benefits of open source software include:

Collaboration: Open source software is often developed collaboratively by a community of developers who contribute to the project and make improvements over time.

Cost: Open source software is typically free to use and distribute, which can result in significant cost savings for organizations.

Many popular software programs and applications, including the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, and the Mozilla Firefox web browser, are examples of open source software.
